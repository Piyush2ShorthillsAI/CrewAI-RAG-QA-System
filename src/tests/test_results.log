This feature allows agents to tackle tasks that require computational or programmatic solutions.\n\nTo enable code execution for an agent, you need to set the `code_execution` parameter to `True` when creating the agent. The page also recommends using more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 when enabling code execution, as they have a better understanding of programming concepts and are more likely to generate correct and efficient code.\n\nThe page explains that the code execution feature includes error handling, where if executed code raises an exception, the agent will receive the error message and can attempt to correct the code or provide alternative solutions. Additionally, it mentions that you need to install the `crewai_tools` package to use this feature.\n\nThe page also provides a detailed example of creating an agent with code execution capabilities and using it in a task, showcasing how the agent can write and execute Python code to perform data analysis tasks.", "similarity_percentage_query_1_to_404": 76.23762376237624, "passed": 308, "failed": 96}
