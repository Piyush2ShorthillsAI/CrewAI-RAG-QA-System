A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.\n\nThe page explains that there are two ways to create crews in CrewAI: using YAML configuration or defining them directly in code. It also discusses various attributes and functionalities of crews, including:\n\n* The `max_requests_per_minute` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits.\n* Tasks will be executed in the order they are defined.\n* The `Crew` class provides a structured way to access results of the crew's execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.\n* The output of a crew includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual task outputs.\n* Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time.\n* Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.\n* The page also explains how to initiate the workflow with the `start` method, which starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process, such as `start`, `async_start`, `sync_start`, and `replay`. It also explains how to use the replay feature in CrewAI to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI).", "similarity_percentage_query_1_to_147": 80.95238095238095, "passed": 119, "failed": 28}
